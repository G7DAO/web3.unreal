Our Philosophy
=======================================

Goals and Values
--------------------

**Our guiding philosophy for web3.unreal is to be as decentralized, trustless, and developer friendly as possible.**

Therefore, we will not support or integrate custodial solutions.

We will not perform web3 functionality on an external, centralized server. We will build this out in engine even if it is much more difficult.

* This is also more cost effective and convenient to developers as they have less infrastructure to manage

We will maintain an open source and permissively licensed codebase

We will provide developers the maximum functionality and flexibility possible

We will work together with the open source community to build this project as a common good to advance the adoption of web3 gaming and enable economic models that put players first rather than corporate profits.
